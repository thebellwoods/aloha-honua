# aloha-moon

This is a short series of Lua & Playdate examples that build off each other. By mastering all seven challenges, one should confident enough to build their own game.

When I first heard the name lua, I thought it might be Hawaiian in origin; as in luau! But it's actually Portuguese meaning "moon". You can learn more about the origin on the [lua wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>)

### VS Code

I'm using VS Code to build this project which is made possible by [pddx](https://github.com/colingourlay/pddx).

```
npm install
npm start
```

Much thanks to [playdate-metroidvania](https://github.com/colingourlay/playdate-metroidvania) for this familar setup

## Challenges

Each of these examples are more like challenges since I didn't know how to accomplish them before writing each one. I may not actually complete each challenge but hopefully I'll at least learn something new during the struggle.

#### 1. Hello

<img src="./source/challenges/1-hello/menu.png" style="width: 400px" />

what can I do with the sample lua playdate code from [writing a game](https://sdk.play.date/2.0.3/Inside%20Playdate.html#_writing_a_game)? Can I draw a background, a player (that acts like a cursor), and series of options that the player can stand next to and select?

#### Artists

[headwinds](https://github.com/headwinds) is primarily a fronted dev with Javascript as most comfortable language, and will be attempting to adapt many common patterns from web dev to lua.
