# aloha-moon
aloha moon is a short series of hello world type examples in Lua on the Playdate console to help learn the language. 

When I first heard the name lua, I thought it might Hawaiian as in luau! But it's actually [Portuguese meaning "moon" and learn about the origin on the [lua wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))

  
## Challenges 

Each of these examples are more like challenges since I didn't know how to accomplish them before writing each one. I may not actually complete each challenge but hopefully I'll at least something during the struggle.
